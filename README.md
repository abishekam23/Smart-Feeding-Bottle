# Smart-Feeding-Bottle

The Smart Feeding Bottle is an innovative solution designed to enhance the feeding experience for infants and caregivers alike. Incorporating advanced sensors and wireless communication technology, this intelligent bottle ensures optimal temperature and liquid quality for the baby's consumption. The bottle features a DS18B20 temperature sensor and a TDS water quality sensor, which continuously monitor the temperature and dissolved solids in the liquid contents. 

Data from these sensors are transmitted to a mobile app via an ESP32 microcontroller, allowing caregivers to remotely monitor and control the feeding process. With real-time notifications, customizable alerts with buzzer, and a user-friendly interface, the Smart Feeding Bottle offers convenience, peace of mind, and confidence in every feeding session
